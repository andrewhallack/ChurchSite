export const churchStory = `Holy Protection of the Mother of God Orthodox Christian Church is part of an extended Orthodox Christian community in Houston, Texas. This extended community encompasses thousands of faithful of various ethnic backgrounds. Orthodox Christianity is rooted in the faith of the Apostles of Christ. It was ten years ago when a group of enthusiastic people from Houston decided to start a new Orthodox Christian Mission in the southwest part of the city. The goal was to serve the Orthodox Christian faithful in that area and develop an Orthodox Christian outreach.

Our first meetings and our first services were held in the homes of the faithful, following the tradition of the early Church. Because of our strong and close beginnings, we developed a family-focused mission. When we outgrew using a home, we rented various places. We also reached agreements with other Orthodox Churches in the Houston area to hold services together. While engaging in prayer, Bible study, the blessing of houses, spiritual counseling, and community service, we also developed a project that would help us to keep growing. We needed a property. From the beginning we formed a committee to identify ways of raising money and to find a good location based on where our members were living.

By the grace of God and with the generosity of many people, on March 9th, 2011, we succeeded in taking a very important step. We purchased about two beautiful acres of land in the southwest area of Houston. In the meantime, we continued to work towards maintaining and increasing our membership. The construction committee decided on a two-phase project. The first phase will consist of a multipurpose building that will serve both as a liturgical, prayerful space, as well as a social hall. This will be followed by a second phase which will consist of the sanctuary. Our purchasing the property and moving towards having a permanent place to worship fulfill our primary goal which has never changed: to come together in community to worship Christ and share His love with our neighbors.
